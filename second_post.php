			<div class="resume-date">By: Kenneth Ruiz | September 15th, 2014</div>
			<p>I've been working on this website for a few weeks now. Well, I've been learning
			about the development process for a couple months, but the website itself has been
			something I've been working on for a few weeks. This is a project I took on
			with very little past web development experience. At the time, I had a basic
			understanding of HTML and CSS syntax. I knew what headers and paragraphs were, and
			that you could style elements using CSS, and I knew that JavaScript existed.<p>
			<p>On the other hand, I had never written PHP, and I didn't understand what divs were, 
			or understand the difference between ids and classes. If you asked me what Apache
			and MySQL were, I would have stared at you for a little while and shrugged. And now
			this website exists. It has actual content on it, it's responsive, it has a navigation 
			bar, and it looks okay! I'm going to tell you what happened, how I got here. And most 
			importantly, I'm going to tell you why each page on my website has a scrollbar, and why
			I still have a lot more to learn.</p>
			<p>I started learning web development from a website called Team Treehouse. There's a
			monthly/yearly subscription for using their learning resources, but it's been well worth
			the expense thus far. There's a lot of similar websites out there (Codecademy, Code School). 
			And I can't recommend Team Treehouse over any other learning resource, it's just what I 
			went with, so take that for what it is. Using their "learning tracks", it's how I've learned 
			all the web development skills (HTML, CSS, PHP) I have, and some more. I'm still using their
			website at the time of this post to get a deeper understanding of MySQL, so I can develop the
			back end of this website.</p>
			<p><span class="off-color">Fun fact</span>: As of right now (September 2014), blog posts are being hard-coded into this
			website. Meaning log posts aren't being stored and retrieved from a database, but that's
			what I'm working on accomplishing next. That's going to take some time for me to implement, 
			but I'd like there the be some content on the website, so writing posts in an HTML document
			will have to suffice for now.</p>
			<p><span class="off-color">Fun Fact II</span>: Also as of right now, my website isn't even being
			hosted online. I haven't even paid for a domain name as of right now because, again, I wanted
			there to be some content on the website before deploying.</p>
			<p>I'm using Apache as my web-server application. I've used Nginx in the past, but I chose Apache
			just because it's the most familiar to me. At the time of writing this, I'm attending a Linux
			system administration school called the Rackspace Open Cloud Academy. This is where I've gained
			most of my foundational technical skills and learned how to configure things like Apache and MySQL.
			When I develop from home, I develop on a virtual machine deployed using Vagrant and VirtualBox. I learned 
			how to use Vagrant the old-fashioned way- reading the documentation and rolling my face across the keyboard
			when something didn't work the way I expected it to.</p>
			<p>For version control, I use git and GitHub. Team Treehouse also had a learning track for using 
			version control, so credit goes out to them for teaching me that too.</p>
