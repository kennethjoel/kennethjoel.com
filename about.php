			<h1>About</h1> 
			<p>As you might know by now, my name is Kenneth Joel Ruiz. <span class="ti-face-smile"></span></p>
			<p>Cibolo, Texas is the town I would tell you I'm from if you asked, but I've been around a few places. Aside from Texas, I've lived in Puerto Rico for 10 years when I was a youngling. But for the last 10 years and counting, Texas has been home for me. </p>
			<p>While living here, I studied Computer Science (with a minor in Math!) at Texas State University-San Marcos. And during the summer of 2014 I enrolled in a program outside of school called the Rackspace Open Cloud Academy. At the Open Cloud Academy, I studied Linux system administration.</p>
			<p>When I'm not focusing on web development or other miscellaneous studies, I'm tending to my two fantastic kitties, Lucius and Isaac McFinnigan!</p>

			<p>Lucius is a cat that was rescued from the parking lot of a Bucc-ee's travel center when he was just a kitten. Lucius' hobbies include licking blinds, sitting in awkward positions, and chasing flies that sneak into the apartment. Isaac McFinnigan was a cat we took in from a previous owner who could no longer keep him; he was 6 years old when we brough him in. Isaac doesn't have time for a lot of hobbies because he requires 11.9 hours of sleep, and 11.3 hours of being petted. The remaining time is spent doing a combination of both.</p>

			<p>Bye Bye!</p>
