			<h1>About</h1> 
			<p>As you might know by now, my name is Kenneth Joel Ruiz. I'm from a small(ish) town in Texas called Cibolo, but I'm fortunate enough that I've been able to call a handful of places home. I was born in Ft. Benning, Georgia in 1993, but spent my childhood in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico for ten years until I moved to the San Antonio area here in Texas. Since living here, I've graduated high school and attended Texas State University-San Marcos for two and a half years. Outside of college, I studied Linux system administration at the Rackspace Open Cloud Academy, and web development as a hobbyist at home.</p>
