1. Fix the issue with the "Resume" page displaying differently that the other main pages (Blog, Contact, etc.). Clicking the "Resume" page causes the webpage to shift slightly. 

2. Center the "Skills" section on the "Resume" page on the bottom of the page. Improve the general styling of the skill badges. 

3. Create a footer and fix the broken Themify icons.
