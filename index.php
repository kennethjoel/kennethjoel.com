			<p>The last week at Open Cloud is called "System Administration" week, and students are 
			placed into a faux-ticket-queue and given practice tickets to work. The tickets can range from 
			configuring a mail server to setting up virtual hosts for a web server. The ticket I worked on
			involved creating a web server for a customer, and configuring it to work with Varnish. Now, I'm 
			familiar with Varnish, and I understand what it does, but I've never installed and configured it
			before. Alright, no problem. I open my search engine of choice, and start digging in.</p>
			<p>When I have to implement a solution I haven't used before, I do a few things. First, 
			I find the general documentation for solution, in this case, Varnish. Next, I attempt to gain a
			surface level understanding of what the solution I'm using actually does. I feel like
			I understand what Varnish does well enough to begin working on the ticket, but I poke around 
			online to make sure I'm not mistaken. This saves me from backpedaling later if I'm wrong, and it 
			doesn't take long to do; worst case being that I found out what I already knew. The last thing
			I do is open up a guide or resource independent of the official documentation that helps
			me do what I need to do. This is useful since documentation doesn't tend to outline common pitfalls
			you can run into while working.</p>
			<p>A problem I tend to run into when working on certain issues is having what I consider to be
			documentation tunnel vision.
