			<p>The last week at Open Cloud is called "System Administration" week, and students are 
			placed into a faux-ticket-queue and given practice tickets to work. The tickets can range from 
			configuring a mail server to setting up virtual hosts for a web server. The ticket I worked on
			involved creating a web server for a customer, and configuring it to work with Varnish. Now, I'm 
			familiar with Varnish, and I understand what it does, but I've never installed and configured it
			before. Alright, no problem. I open my search engine of choice, and start digging in.

			<p>I've been working on this website for a few weeks now. Well, I've been learning
			about the development process for a couple months, but the website itself has been
			something I've been working on for a few weeks. This is a project I took on
			with very little past web development experience. At the time, I had a basic
			understanding of HTML and CSS syntax. I knew what headers and paragraphs were, and
			that you could style elements using CSS, and I knew that JavaScript existed.
			</p>
			<p>On the other hand, I had never written PHP, and I didn't understand what divs were, 
			or understand the difference between ids and classes.</p>
